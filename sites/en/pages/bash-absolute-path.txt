There can be many reasons why you'd want to get the exact location of your currently running script.
Luckily there is a command called <hl>realpath</hl> that will calculate and print the absolute path
of a given path.

=abstract end

Let's see how it works:

<include file="examples/shell/absolute.sh">

<hl>$0</hl> is the name of the current script as it was executed. So if we run the script as <hl>./examples/shell/absolute.sh</hl>
then that will be the content of <hl>$0</hl>.

<hl>realpath</hl> prints the abosulte path.

<hl>dirname</hl> prints the directory name, leaving the last part of the path which is in this case the name of the
file.

Let's see a couple of examples:

<code>
$ ./examples/shell/absolute.sh

./examples/shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell
</code>


<code>
$ cd examples/shell/
$ ./absolute.sh                                                      # run right where it is

./absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell
</code>

<code>
$ cd ../../sites/en                                                  # go to a cousin of the scripts directory
$ ../../examples/shell/absolute.sh                                   # run relatively from there

../examples/shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell
</code>

<code>
$ ln -s ../../examples/shell/                                        # create a symbolic link to the directory
$ ./shell/absolute.sh                                                # run using the symlink

./shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell
</code>

<code>
$ ln -s ../../examples/shell/absolute.sh                             # create a symlink to the script
$ ./absolute.sh                                                      # run using the symlink

./absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell
</code>

<code>
$ /home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell/absolute.sh         # run with full path

/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell
</code>

<code>
$ export PATH=/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell:$PATH   # make sure the directory of the script is in the path
$ cd                                                                 # go home
$ absolute.sh                                                        # run without knowing where it is

/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell/absolute.sh
/home/gabor/work/code-maven.com/examples/shell

As you can see in every case <hl>$</hl> was exactly as we invoked the script. Except of the last case where we invoked
it by name only and relied on the content of the <hl>PATH</hl> environment variable and the shell to find the script.
In that case <b>$0</b> already contained the full path.

However the 2nd and 3rd line of output were exactly the same in every case.

So we can rely on the <hl>realpath</hl> to consistently return the real full path of the script.
Even if we execute it via a symbolic link.
