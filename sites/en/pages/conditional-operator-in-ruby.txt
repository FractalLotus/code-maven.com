=abstract start

The official name of the <hl>? :</hl> operator is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:">conditional operator</a>,
though most people know it as the <b>ternary operator</b> indicating the number of operands it has.

=abstract end

There are several <b>unary operators</b> that handle a single operand. For example <hl>-</hl> can be unary operator.

Most of the operators ad <b>binary operators</b> that handle two operands. For example <hl>*</hl> always needs two operands to
work on, but in most cases <hl>-</hl> is also used as a binary operatory.

There is only one <b>ternary operator</b>, that has 3 operands. It is called the <b>conditional operator</b>, but because
it is the only one with 3 operands, most of the people call it <b>the ternary operator</b>.


<h2>Conditional Operator in Ruby</h2>

In general it looks like this:

<code>
CONDITION ? EVALUATE_IF_CONDITION_WAS_TRUE : EVALUATE_IF_CONDITION_WAS_FALSE
</code>

It evaluates the <hl>CONDITION</hl>. If it is <hl>true</hl> then the code evaluates the part between <hl>?</hl> and <hl>:</hl> and returns the result.
If the <hl>CONDITION</hl> is false, then the middle part is skipped and the 3rd part is evaluated and the result of that expression is returned.

<h2>Example puts</h2>

In this example the return value of the conditional operator is passed to <hl>puts</hl>

<code>
filename = ARGV.shift
puts filename ? filename : 'No file given'
</code>

<h2>Example smaller</h2>

In this example we check whihc one of the two random values is smaller and return that one:
