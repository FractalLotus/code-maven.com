Sometime there is some code that you would like to run at the beginning of every request. Insead of insert the same code everywhere or
event just inserting a function call in every route handler, Flask has an easy way to accomplish this using the <b>before_request</b> hook.

Run as:

<code>
FLASK_APP=app FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
</code>
