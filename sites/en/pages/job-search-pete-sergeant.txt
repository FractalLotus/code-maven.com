Pete Sergeant is a Developer Manager turned recruiter who runs the <a href="https://perl.careers/">Perl Careers</a>
and <a href="https://careersjs.com/">CareersJS</a>. If you are the reader of the <a href="https://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly newsletter</a>
(edite by yours truly) then you have seen his job posts at the bottom of each edition.
(Well, we had a break during the heights of the Corona virus pandemic, but he is back with his job offers.)

This is going to be a live webinar in which you'll be able to ask him questions and share your LinkedIn profile to get his (public)
feedback on how to improve it.
