IntelliJ shows me a notification on MS Windows when the tests are done. (At least if it is not in focus).
This helps me bring back my focus if I switched it away.

I would like to have a similar for my command line on Linux. Either running the commands with some prefix
or automatically on every command on the terminal. Maybe on every long running command.

=abstract end

<code>
notify-send Done "$command"
</code>

I even created a file called <b>not</b> with the following content:

<code>
#!/bin/bash
command=$*
#echo $*
$*
notify-send Done "$command"
</code>

I put it somewhere in my PATH and made it executable <b>chmod +x not</b>.

Now I can run

<code>
not command
</code>

and I'll get a notification when the job is done.
