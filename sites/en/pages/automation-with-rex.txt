=abstract start

During this meeting <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferki/">Ferenc Erki</a>, the lead developer of <a href="https://www.rexify.org/">Rex</a> taught
us to set up and configure his hosts using Rex.

We started from an empty management machine. Installed Rex. Created two Ubuntu-based servers. First we had some basic experimentation with Rex
then installed and configured Nginx.

This is the history of the shell commands that we used during the meetig. I tried to clean the duplicate entries.
I hope having them here makes it easier to reproduce the commands.
