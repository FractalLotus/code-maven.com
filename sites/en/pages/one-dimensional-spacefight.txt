=abstract start

You are the pilot of a spaceship and your task is to fire upon and hit the enemy spaceship.

You are in one-dimensional space.

=abstract end


<h2>Level 0</h2>

<ul>
   <li>The computer creates a random integer number between 0-100 "the space" which is the distance of the spaceship from you</li>
   <li>You guess the distance by typing in a number.</li>
   <li>The computer write if it is a hit or not</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 1</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The computer can tell you if your shot was too short or too long.</li>
    <li>The computer will allow you to shoot multiple times.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 2</h2>

<ul>
    <li>If the user hits x, s/he leaves the game without finishing it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 3</h2>

<ul>
    <li>If the user presses 's', show the hidden value (cheat)</li>
    <li>If the user presses 'd' the game gets into debug mode: the system starts to show the current number to guess every time, just before asking the user for new input. Pressing 'd' again turns off debug mode. (It is a toggle.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 4</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The 'm' button is another toggle. It is called 'move mode'. When it is 'on', the object move a little bit after every step (+/-2). Pressing 'm' again will turn this feature off.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 5</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Let the user guess several times.</li>
    <li>Pressing 'n' will skip this game and start a new one (generate new number to guess).</li>
</ul>


<code>
Allow the user to type
n   - skip this game and start a new one (generate new number to guess)
s   - show the hidden value (cheat)
d   - debug mode 
      (It is a toggle. 
       Pressing once the system starts to show the current
       number to guess every time before asking the user for new input
       pressing again, turns off the behavior.
       )
m   - move mode
      (It is a toggle.
       Pressing once the object will start to move a little bit after
       every step. Pressing again will turn this feature off.)
x   - exit
</code>

<ul>
    <li>Make the size of the space configurable.</li>
    <li>Make sure the enemy does not wander off the training field.</li>
    <li>Give warning if the user shoots out of space.</li>
    <li>Keep track of the minimum and maximum number of hits (in a file or database).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level</h2>

Refactor the code to be nice small functions e.g. for

<ul>
    <li>moving of the spaceship</li>
    <li>checking the hit</li>
</ul>
