Create an account on <a href="https://azure.com">Azure</a>

Create a Virtual machine (I used a Standard_B1 with 1 vcpu and 1 Gb memory that costs $7.59 / month)
I have added my public key in order to make it easy to ssh to the box.
Once it was ready I logged in:

<code>
ssh azureuser@20.106.137.104
</code>

Inside I can run "sudo" commands without providing a password. In fact I don't even have a password for any of the users on this machine.
