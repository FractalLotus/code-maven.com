Pillow is a fork of PIL. You should use Pillow these days.

<h2>Install Pillow</h2>

Before you can use it you need to install the Pillow library.
Read the <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/">documentation of Pillow</a> on how to install it on your operating system.

<h2>Draw a simple image with one color</h2>

<code lang="python">
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
img = Image.new(mode, size, color)
img.save(filename)
</code>

There are various values for <b>mode</b> listed in the documentation of Pillow. For example RGB and RGBA can be modes.
The <b>size</b> is a tuple in the form of (width, height) in pixels.
The <b>color</b> can be a word such as 'red', or a triplet for RGB colors of 3 values between 0-255.

This script:

<include file="examples/python/pil_new_red_image.py">

will create this image:

<img src="/img/pil_red.png" alt="red rectangular" />

We can also use the individual RGB values in their decimal form taken from some color wheel or other color selector application.

<include file="examples/python/pil_new_color_image.py">

The result is this:

<img src="/img/pil_color.png" alt="red rectangular" />


<h2>Writing text on image</h2>

For this we also need to import <hl>ImageDraw</hl>. We pass the location of the top-left corner of the text,
the text itself, and the color of the text. There are number of other parameters you can pass to this method.

<include file="examples/python/pil_write_text_on_image.py">

The result is this:

<img src="/img/pil_text.png" alt="" />


<h2>Selecting the font</h2>

There are a number of ways to select the font used for writing on the image. We need to import and use the <hl>ImageFont</hl>
to load a TrueType font. Mac OSX supplies a bunch of fonts that are located in the <hl>/Library/Fonts/</hl>.
On other platforms you'll need to locate the files yourself and then pass the full path to the function.
Alternatively you could include the font-file in your application and then you can know where is the font-file relative to your code.

In this example we load the font using the <hl>truetype</hl> method of the <hl>ImageFont</hl> passing to it the path to
the fonts and the size of the fonts to be loaded.

<include file="examples/python/pil_write_text_on_image_select_font.py">

The result is this:

<img src="/img/pil_text_font.png" alt="" />
