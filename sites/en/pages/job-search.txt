<h2>Some of my questions</h2>

Some of the questions I thought of that might be relevant for the webinar.

Take them as the general directions.

<ul>
    <li>Tell me about yourself and about the company you work for!</li>
    <li>What does the hiring process look like at your firm? How long does it take? How many interviews?</li>
    <li>Are all of your open positions advertised publicly? If not how do you fill the others?</li>
    <li>Is it a good idea to contact you directly if I am interested in a position at your firm?</li>
    <li>Should I look for someone who works at the same place to recommend me? Is it better to submit my resume via LinkedIn or directly to you or some other way?</li>
    <li>How do you determine who you contact via LinkedIn? What features of the profile are you looking for? Do the recommendations matter? The skills? The activities?</li>
    <li>What can I do now to improve my chances?</li>
    <li>Can I do anything to improve my position in your eyes?</li>
    <li>How important is a degree vs. experience in the field?</li>
    <li>If I have never had a fixed job in the industry before how can I get my first job? (e.g. if I just finished my degree, but have never worked in the industry or I was working in some unrelated field and I am trying to switch.)</li>
    <li>Is there any way I can gain experience without having a job? How do you view home made projects? How do you view contributions to open source projects?</li>
    <li>How should I prepare for an interview?</li>
    <li>If I really like your company and I'd like to be able to apply for a job to you 2-5 years from now, what do you recommend I do now?</li>
    <li>Alternatively: If you could go back 2-5 years what would you have suggested I do so you would want to hire me for one of your open positions?</li>
    <li>Show us how you search and what you think during your search. You can bring an existing open position you are looking for, a past one, or a made up one and then show us your process.</li>
    <li>What do you think about gaps in employment? How would you represent them on your LinkedIn profile and in your CV?</li>
    <li>Do you ask people about their salary expectation? When I am asked about my salary expectaion what shall I say?</li>
</ul>
