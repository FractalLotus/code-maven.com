=abstract start

The <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/os.html">os</a> module of Python provides a function called <b>walk</b>
that makes it easy to go over all the directories and files in a directory tree.

It is also quite easy to skip some of the subtrees.

=abstract end

Here you can see an example how to go over a directory tree.

Changing the content of <b>dir</b> variable allows us to skip some of the subdirectories.

In the first example we only skip the <b>.git</b> directory, in the next example that is currently committed
out, we have a more complex filter that will make it skip a number of different subdirectories.
