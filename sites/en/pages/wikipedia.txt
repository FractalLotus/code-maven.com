=abstract start

<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> is great, especially if you speak one of the major languages.

Unfortunately there are many people who cannot read these major languages, and even if they can, it is much easer
to understand thing in their own mother tongue.

On the other hand there are many articles on Wikipedia that are available in one of the "smaller"
languages, but not in English. I belive making these available in English as well would be important.

=abstract end

I have a number of projects in mind trying to help people who would like to contribute to Wikipedia
locate areas with some "low hanging fruits". The first such project is locating all the articles
that are available in one language, but apparently not available in English.

The way to identify them is to look for articles that have no link to their English counterpart.
These articles might be just missing the link, or there might be no English version of the page.

If you'd like to help check out the articles.

If you can locate the English version of the article then click on the "Interwiki link editor" on the side
of the non-English article and add a link to the Engish version. Then go to the English article and add a link
in the other direction as well.
I am not sure, but I think the rest of the Interwiki links will be added automatically by a bot within a few days.

If there is no English counterpart for the article then start translating!

<h2>Source code</h2>

The pages are generated by <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/wikipedia-translations">this code</a>. In the <b>languages.json</b>
we have the list of languages and also the list of pages to be skipped. These are pages that are probbaly
not interesting to anyone except the speakers of that language.
