=abstract start

The <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/">requests</a> module of Python is one of the most common libraries to
be used as an HTTP client.

<a href="http://httpbin.org/">httpbin.org</a> is a nice service that you can use to try various HTTP requests.

In this articel I have collected a couple of the examples written using Python requests.

=abstract end

<h2>HTTP GET</h2>

<include file="examples/python/httpbin/get.py">

The output will look like this:

<include file="examples/python/httpbin/get.out">

<h2>HTTP POST</h2>

<include file="examples/python/httpbin/post.py">

The output will look like this:

<include file="examples/python/httpbin/post.out">

<h2>Basic Authentication</h2>

<include file="examples/python/httpbin/basic_auth.py">

What happens if you don't provide the credentials:

<include file="examples/python/httpbin/basic_auth_no_credentials.py">

What happens if you provide the wrong credentials?
