<h2>About the show</h2>

If you are thinking about suggesting yourself or someone else to be on the show, but were wondering if that would be
relevant, I've tried to group together the types of guests we had so far:

<ul>
  <li>Project managers like <a href="/cmos-5-lucy-greco-dictationbridge">Lucy Greco</a> and
     <a href="/cmos-8-lynn-cyrin-bundler-rubygems">Lynn 'Cyrin' Conway</a></li>
  <li>Core developers of a project like <a href="/cmos-7-obinwanne-hill-restivejs">Obinwanne Hill</a> and
      <a href="/cmos-4-tom-hudson-gron">Tom Hudson</a>, or <a href="/cmos-9-ire-aderinokun">Ire Aderinokun</a></li>
  <li>Contributor of a project like <a href="/cmos-3-joel-berger-mojolicious">Joel Berger</a>.</li>
  <li>Enthusiastic (and very knowledgable) user like <a href="/cmos-6-tally-barak-graphql">Tally Barak</a>.</li>
</ul>

The episodes usually last less than 25 minutes.

<h2>Other recommended podcasts</h2>

If you are interested in deep discussions with open source developers, I recommend
the <a href="https://changelog.com/">ChangeLog</a> and the <a href="https://changelog.com/rfc/">Request For Commits</a>. 

If you are new to progamming I'd recommend the <a href="http://codenewbie.org/">CodeNewbie</a> podcast.

They are awesome.

<h2>How to listen to podcasts?</h2>

Personally I use <b>Podcast Addict on Android</b> and I've <a href="http://szabgab.com/podcasts.html">described it how</a> along with
a few other recommended podcasts. In addition there are plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+listen+to+podcasts">explanations on YouTube</a>.
