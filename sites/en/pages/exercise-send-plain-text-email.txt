Exercise: Send plain text e-mail.

=abstract end

Create a function that will get one or more addresses where <hl>To</hl> send the message,
0 or more address to <hl>Cc</hl> the message. A single addres to pretend as the <hl>From</hl> field.

Get a string to be the <hl>Subject</hl> line and some plain text to be the body of the e-mail.


By default this should assume to be running on a Linux/Unix system with a properly configured sendmail program
and use that as the underlying transporting system.


Then also add an optional parameter <hl>SMTP</hl> that holds the name or IP address of an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">SMTP server</a>.
When this parameter is given, use the SMTP server to send the e-mail.
