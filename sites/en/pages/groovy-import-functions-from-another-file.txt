Code reuse is an important part of programming. The smallest possible way is to create functions and call them
several times in the same code. The next step is to have a set of functions in a file and use those functions in
several other files.

In this example we see how to do that with simple functions.

<h2>Importing function</h2>

In this example we have a very simple "library" file with a simple function:

<include file="examples/groovy/function_tools.gvy">

Next to it there is another file in which we load the former file into memory and then call it.

<include file="examples/groovy/function_script.gvy">

We can then run

<pre>
groovy function_script.gvy
</pre>

In the code we gave the path to the library so in this version it needs to be next to the code loading it.

<h2>Importing class methods</h2>

This is the class:

<include file="examples/groovy/class_tools.gvy">

This is the script:

<include file="examples/groovy/class_script.gvy">

<h2>Importing class methods</h2>


<include file="examples/groovy/a/main.groovy">

<include file="examples/groovy/a/tools.groovy">


<h2>Import class from a subdirectory</h2>


<include file="examples/groovy/b/main.groovy">

<include file="examples/groovy/b/tools/other.groovy">
