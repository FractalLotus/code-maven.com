If you are an event organizer with a new group it might be tricky to find a good place for your gathering,
but even if you already have a large group with a long history you might be interested
to find alternative places to hold your events.
It can broaden the membership and can make your group more accessible to pepple living and working in other areas of the country.

On this page you'll find some of the best venues where you can organize your events. The majority seem to be in the
center of the country, especially in Tel Aviv, but I included information about other cities as well.

<h2>The questions</h2>

Throught this post I am trying to answer the following questions about each place:

<ul>
    <li>Name of the place. Obviously.</li>
    <li>Location (address).</li>
    <li>The available spaces. (number of people, types of events: presentations only, hands-on events as well, or just round-table chats?)</li>
    <li>How to get a time-slot to organize an event? (The process of registration)</li>
    <li>What kind of events and content are they interested in?</li>
    <li>At what time can event be organized?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tel-aviv">Tel Aviv</h2>

<h2><a href="https://www.campus.co/tel-aviv/en">Google for Startups</a> - Tel Aviv</h2>

<a href="https://www.campus.co/tel-aviv/en">Google for Startups</a> (was Google Campus) is located in
HaUmanim 12, Tel Aviv, near the Azrieli towers. A very central location in Tel Aviv easily accessible with public transportation.
On the other hand arriving by car can be tricky.

They have 3 options to host events.

<ul>
   <li>The Event Space (142 people) good for presentations.</li>
   <li>The Classroom (24 people) good for presentations and hands-on workshops.</li>
   <li>The Cafe (60 people) good for hands-on workshops, hackathons.</li>
</ul>

They are open Sunday-Thursday 6:00-23:00 and you can schedule events during the day as well.

They have an on-line registration form to apply where you can see the available time-slots.
Soon after you submit your request to hold an event they send you their approval or they might ask
for clarification.

They are usually open to any type of technical event.

They also have their own calendar of events and promote your event to their members.
