Meetup organizers are always looking for interesting places to hold their events. I hope that this
collection will help them find some venues they have not tried yet.

<h2><a href="https://www.campus.co/tel-aviv/en">Google for Startups</a> - Tel Aviv</h2>

<a href="https://www.campus.co/tel-aviv/en">Google for Startups</a> (was Google Campus) is located in
HaUmanim 12, Tel Aviv, near the Azrieli towers. A very central location in Tel Aviv easily accessible with public transportation.

They have 3 options to host events.

<ul>
   <li>The Event Space (142 people) good for presentations.</li>
   <li>The Classroom (24 people) good for presentations and hands-on workshops.</li>
   <li>The Cafe (60 people) good for hands-on workshops, hackathons.</li>
</ul>

They are open Sunday-Thursday 6:00-23:00 and you can schedule events during the day as well.

They have an on-line registration form to apply where you can see the available time-slots.
Soon after you submit your request to hold an event they send you their approval or they might ask
for clarification.

They are usually open to any type of technical event.

to find a venue there, it is probably best to talk to the organizers of one of the few existing groups.
