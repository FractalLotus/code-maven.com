Unless it is only an API returning JSON files, in a web application you will have many static files.
Images, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc. Usually on your production server you will want these
to be served by a web server such as nginx or Apache as those are faster and more suitable for such job.

However during development you probably won't want to have a web server on your computer. For that time
you probbaly need Flask to serve the static files as well.

Flask can do it easily, out of the box.

We have the following directory layout:

<code>
.
├── static
│   ├── css
│   │   └── style.css
│   └── img
│       └── code_maven_128.png
├── templates
│   └── main.html
└── web.py
</code>

The "application" is rather simple. It has only one page returning a rendered template:

<include file="examples/flask/stat/web.py">

The template itself is also simple. It is based on the <a href="/html-skeleton">HTML 5 skeleton</a>

<include file="examples/flask/stat/templates/main.html">

<include file="examples/flask/stat/static/css/style.css">
