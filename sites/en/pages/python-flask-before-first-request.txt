Sometimes you would like to have code that will be executed once, before ant user arrives to your site, before the first
request arrives. You could put some code in the body of your Flask application file, that code will execute
when the application launches. Alternatively, and in many case in a cleaner way you could use the <b>before_first_request</b> hook.

Run as:

<code>
FLASK_APP=app FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
</code>


Output on the console:

<code>
