=abstract start

One of the selling points of using Node.js to write the back-end of your application is that in that case you use the same programming
language in the back-end as you use in the front-end. Then it is easy to share code between the two.

The question then, how can one write a library in JavaScript that can be used both in Node.js and in the web client.


=abstract end

This is a simple library with two methods: <hl>add</hl> and <hl>div</hl>, and an attribute <hl>version</hl>
It uses <hl>this</hl> which refers to the Window object when running in the browser and to the global object when running under Node.js

<include file="examples/js/node_and_web/calc.js">

We can see it working in Node:

<include file="examples/js/node_and_web/calc_test_node.js">

<code>
$  node calc_test_node.js
calc_test_node
7
4
0.01
</code>


We can see it working in the web as well. For that we need to write some JavaScript code:

<include file="examples/js/node_and_web/calc_test_web.js">

and then we have to load first the <hl>calc.js</hl> and then the JAvaScript file that uses the <hl>Calc</hl> object:

<try file="examples/js/node_and_web/calc_test_web.html">

If you click on "Try" you will see it working. Just remember you need to open the JavaScript console to see anything.
