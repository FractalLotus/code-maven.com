=abstract start

In this <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-119/">weekly challenge</a> the task was to swap the lower and upper 4 bits (nibbles) of an integer.

This is my implementation in the <a href="/crystal">Crystal language</a>.

At first I thought to convert the number to its binary representation and do the swapping there, but then I fugured it is just a simple mathematical operation.

=abstract end

<ul>
  <li><b>%</b> is modulo</li>
  <li><b>//</b> is integer division</li>
</ul>

Below the function I included the code to iterate over the range between 0 and 255 (inclusive)
and for each iteration print the binary representation (padded with 0s) and the decimal representation of the original number
followed by the decimal representation of the nibble-swapped number.
