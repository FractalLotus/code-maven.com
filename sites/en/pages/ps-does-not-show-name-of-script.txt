Recently, on a CentOS box I've noticed that when I run <hl>ps -ef</hl> or <hl>ps axuw</hl> some of my scripts don't show
up. I also checked this on Ubuntu 19.04 with similar results.

TLDR: add <hl>#!/bin/bash</hl> as the first line of your Bash script.

I ran a little experiment.

=abstract end

Created a script called <b>hello.sh</b> with the following content:

<include file="examples/shell/hello.sh">

Made it executable: <hl>chmod +x hello.sh</hl> and ran it:

<code>
./hello.sh &
</code>

I tried to see if I can find the process using ps and grepping for the name of the process, but it did not show up.

<code>
ps -ef | grep hello
</code>

Then I did the same but this time grepping for the process ID. (That's why I printed it in my experimental script.)

<code>
ps -ef | grep 12345
</code>

This time I saw the process and the name of the process was <hl>-bash</hl>.

<h2>sh-bang line</h2>

Usually in Linux/Unix the first line of each script should point to the command that will be able to interpret the code
in the file. It is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">sh-bang</a>.

I've added it to the script (and renamed it becasue the web site can only have one file with the same name):

<include file="examples/shell/hello_again.sh">

Making this executable: <hl>chmod +x hello_again.sh</hl> and runing this the same way: <hl>./hello_again.sh</hl>.
This time the full name showed up in the output of <hl>ps</hl>.

<h2>Running with bash</h2>

I tried also running it with <hl>bash</hl> like this:

<code>
bash hello_again.sh
</code>

On Ubuntu it seems it showd up with the full name, but as I recall in CentOS it had the same result as the first
version, showing up only as <hl>-bash</hl>.
