Reading from the Standard Input (aka. STDIN) which is by default connected to the keyboard is somewhere between
Java and the dynamic languages in lightness.

<h2>Read from STDIN in Groovy</h2>

Reading from the Standard Input, normally the keyboard, is also quite easy.

<hl>System.in</hl> represents the Standard Input channel.

<hl>def</hl> defines a variable name. There is no need to declare the type of the variable.

<hl>println</hl> only takes one argument, so instead of passing a list of values we use the <hl>+</hl>
operator to concatenate the values.

<h2>Read from Console in Groovy</h2>

A shorter alternative is to use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Console.html">Console</a> object, but rumors say that it might not work inside an IDE. It works when running in the terminal.

<h2>Converting string to Integer</h2>

When we read a value from the standard input it arrives as a string. It cannot be used in numerical operations
even if the input looks like a number.
In order to use it as a number we have to tell Groovy to treat it as a number. For example as an Integer.
That's what "as Integer" is for in the next example:

<h2>Rectangular</h2>
