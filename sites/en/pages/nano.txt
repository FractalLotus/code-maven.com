If you are serious about working on Linux, especially as a system administrator or DevOps engineer then you'd better
learn <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> as that is the power editor on Linux. However it has a long and rather steep learning
curve. If you are just getting started with Linux on the command line I'd recommend you first start using Nano, a much simpler
editor that comes installed with Ubuntu and probably with other distributons as well.

I assume you have logged in and you see the prompt:

<img src="/img/vb1/linux_login_1.png">

<h2>Create file with Nano</h2>

Type in:

<code>
$ nano hello.txt
</code>

This will open a text editor in the terminal showing some control options at the bottom:

<img src="/img/vb1/nano-1.png">

Type in some text. e.g.

<code>
Hello World!
How are You?
</code>

In order to save the document click on <hl>Ctrl-o</hl> (See "Write Out" at the bottom of the screen.)
It will offer to write the content with the name "hello.txt".

<img src="/img/vb1/nano-2.png">

Press ENTER.

The file is now saved. We can quit Nano.
Press <hl>Ctrl-X</hl> (see at the bottom for the key-bindings).

This will bring us back to the prompt. We can now list the content of the directory using <hl>ls</hl>.
You'll see something like this:

<img src="/img/vb1/nano-3.png">

We can also display the content of the file using the <hl>cat</hl> command:

<img src="/img/vb1/nano-4.png">

The same way you can edit any other file.

<h2>Edit file</h2>

You can also edit an existing file.

Just type in

<code>
$ nano hello.txt
</code>

again and you'll be back in the editor.


<h2>Exercises</h2>

Play around with the editor.

<ul>
    <li>Create a new file.</li>
    <li>Edit an existing file.</li>
    <li>Exit and check with <hl>cat</hl> that the changes were saved.</li>
    <li>Edit and existing file, make some changes, but exit without saving. Verify (using cat) that the changes were not saved.</li>
    <li>Cut and Paste a line of text. (Paste = Uncut in Nano)</li>
    <li>Search for some text in the document.</li>
</ul>
