<h2>Install Groovy</h2>

There are plenty of ways you can <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/documentation.html#gettingstarted">download and install Groovy</a>.
As I am trying it on Mac OSX and as I already use <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> I just ran

<code>
brew install groovy
</code>

and it installed it for me.

<h2>The version of Groovy</h2>

Then I ran the following command to see which version o f Groovy do I have and on top of which version of the JVM it runs:

<code>
$ groovy -v

Groovy Version: 2.4.15 JVM: 1.8.0_60 Vendor: Oracle Corporation OS: Mac OS X
</code>

<h2>Hello World in Goovy</h2>

Unlike in Java there is not need for a lot of cermony. You can use the <hl>print</hl> function to
print a string to the screen. You can include <hl>\n</hl> to embed a newline character.
There is no need for semi-colon <hl>;</hl> at the end of the statement.

<include file="examples/groovy/hello_world.groovy">

<pre>
$ groovy hello_world.groovy
</pre>

Alternatively you can use the <hl>println</hl> function that will automatically
append a newline to the end of the output.
