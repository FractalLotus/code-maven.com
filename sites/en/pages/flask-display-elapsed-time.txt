In some applications it is a nice idea to show how long it took to load a page. Using the <hl>g</hl> global object and
attaching a function call to it, we can do this fairly close to the real value, without needing to add a lot of extra
code to every route just by using the <hl>before_request</hl> decorator.

Start the application with this command:

<code>
FLASK_APP=app FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
