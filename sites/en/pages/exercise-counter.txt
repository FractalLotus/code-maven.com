=abstract start

There are tons of possiblities to have counters depending on how do you access it and where does it keep the score.
In this exercise you are required to implement a number of different counters.
A few ideas follow:

=abstract end

A command-line single-counter. Every time we run the program it will display an ever increasing number:

<pre>
$ counter
1
$ counter
2
$ counter
3
</pre>

A command-line multi-counter:

<pre>
$ counter Foo
1
$ counter Foo
2
$ counter Bar
1
$ counter Foo
3
$ counter Foo
4
$ counter Bar
2
</pre>

Front-ends:

<ul>
   <li>Command line</li>
   <li>Web browser</li>
   <li>GUI (e.g. Python Tk)</li>
</ul>



You can find many solutions in the <a href="/counter">Counter Examples</a> project.
