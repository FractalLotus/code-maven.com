<h2>Install "at" on Ubuntu</h2>

<code>
sudo apt-get install at
</code>

<h2>Commands in a file - relative time</h2>

Save your commands in a file. e.g.   <b>run.sh</b> will look like this:

<code>
date > a.txt
whoami >> a.txt
</code>

Then schedule it to be execute a minute later:

<code>
at now + 1 minute < run.sh
</code>


<h2>Run without file - relative time</h2>

<code>
echo "date > b.txt" | at now + 1 minute
</code>

A minute later you can check your file system. You'll see a new file called "b.txt" with the date in it.


<h2>Run without file - absolute time</h2>

<code>
echo "date > c.txt" | at 04:58
</code>

At 04:58 the file c.txt will be created with the timestamp in it.
