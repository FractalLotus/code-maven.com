=abstract start

Micro Training Courses are 2-4 hours long training sessions. They can be given either as presentation only or in workshop format
with hands-on exercises.

They are an excellent format to introduce your employees to a topic they are not familiar with without the burden and cost
of sending them to a 3-5 days long training course. They will gain the initial push and then they can either learn by themselves
or go on a full-length training course if they feel the topic warrants the investment.

This is also an excellent format to keep your employees growing and ensure they see your organization as one that is
ready to invest in your employees.
