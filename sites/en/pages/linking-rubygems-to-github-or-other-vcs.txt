=abstract start

Having a <a href="/public-version-control-for-open-source-projects">Public Version Control system</a> for your project is 
quite important, make it easy for people to find it. RubyGems makes it very easy.

=abstract end

Since the release of version 2 of RubyGems we can add any field to the metadata key.

In order to include the <hl>source_code_uri</hl> key add the following to the <hl>gempspec</hl> file of your project
replacing the the URL with the one that matches your project.

<code lang="ruby">
  gem.metadata = {
    "source_code_uri" => "https://github.com/username/project",
  }
</code>

Some people put the URL of their GitHub Repository in the <hl>gem.homepage</hl> fields.
That's ok, but it would be prefereble to also put it in the <hl>source_code_uri</hl> field.
