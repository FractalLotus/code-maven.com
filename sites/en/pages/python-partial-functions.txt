=abstract start

The functools package in Python has a function called <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/functools.html#functools.partial">partial</a> which is similar
to, but not the same as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">Currying</a>.

It helps us create a new function where some of the original arguments have fixed values.

It can be done manually:

<include file="generate_partials.py">

but sometimes you'd like to do that on-the fly with a number of different values of the same parameter.

It can be done using <b>exec</b>:

<include file="generate_partials_on_the_fly_with_exec.py">

but there is a better way to do it using <b>locals</b>.

manually:

<include file="generate_partials_using_locals.py">

on-the fly to many values:

<include file="generate_partials_on_the_fly_with_locals.py">
