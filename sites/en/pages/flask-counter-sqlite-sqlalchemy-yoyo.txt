This is another <a href="/counter">counter example</a> using Flask, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, pytest, but this time we are also usiong <a href="https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest/">youo migration</a>
to maintain the database. An <a href="/flask-counter-sqlite-sqlalchemy">earlier version</a> of this example did not use Yoyo and there we created the schema using SQLAlhemy.

<h2>The application code</h2>

<include file="examples/flask/sqlite-counter-yoyo/app.py">

The way we run queries changed. We now need to call <b>db.session.query</b> and pass it
the class representing the table.

<h2>The SQL migration scripts</h2>

<include file="examples/flask/sqlite-counter-yoyo/migrations/001.sql">
<include file="examples/flask/sqlite-counter-yoyo/migrations/001.rollback.sql">

<h2>The SQLAlchemy code</h2>

<include file="examples/flask/sqlite-counter-yoyo/model.py">

There are two ways to use SQLAlchemy. Either we declare the details of the schema in Python statements as we did in the
<a href="/flask-counter-sqlite-sqlalchemy">other version</a> or we use the <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/automap.html">automap</a> feature
of SQLAlchemy.

As we already have our SQL declarations in the migration files I thought it would be better to try to use the <b>automap_base</b>.

However I could only run this inside the apply_db_migrations function, once we set up the database. So in order to have package level classes
I had to use <b>global</b>. I also used a single class called <b>base</b> instead of one class per table. (And yes I know in this example we only have one table anyway.)
