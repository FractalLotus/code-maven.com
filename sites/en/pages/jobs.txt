Finding a job, especial the first job in hi-tech isn't easy. One of the problems is that you are expected to have experience,
but you don't know how to get experience if you don't have a job.

In this article I try to help you.

TL;DR: Contribute to open source projects and gain experience that way.

<h2>Job descriptions</h2>

Before we get into how to gain that experience, let's see a few job descriptions.

<ul>
     <li><a href="/backend-python-developer">Backend Python developer - Junior Python programmer</a></li>
     <li><a href="/test-automation-engineer">Test Automaton Engineer</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

No matter which field you are interested in you'll have to be able to use Git and GitHub. (In some places it is GitLab or BitBucket. We'll have those covered later.)
So we'll start with that.

<li>
   <li>Read <a href="/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project">How to contribute to an Open Source project?</a></li>
   <li>If you are interested in a DevOps job, check out the list of <a href="/devops">DevOps Tools</a> and see which one you already know and which one you would like to learn.</li>
   <li>Go over the slides of: <a href="https://code-maven.com/slides/collab-dev/">Collaborative Development and Open Source Projects</a> and do the exercies.</li>
