Finding a job, especial the first job in hi-tech isn't easy. One of the problems is that you are expected to have experience,
but you don't know how to get experience if you don't have a job. The typical chicken and egg problem.

In this article I try to help you. Follow these instructions and you will improve your chances to find a job.

TL;DR: Contribute to open source projects and gain experience that way.

<h2>Job descriptions</h2>

Before we get into how to gain that experience, let's see a few job descriptions.

<ul>
     <li><a href="/backend-python-developer">Backend Python developer - Junior Python programmer</a></li>
     <li><a href="/test-automation-engineer">Test Automaton Engineer</a></li>
     <li>TODO: DevOps engineer</li>
     <li>If you are interested in a DevOps job, check out the list of <a href="/devops">DevOps Tools</a> and see which one you already know and which one you would like to learn.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

No matter which field you are interested in you'll have to be able to use Git and GitHub.
(In some places it is GitLab or BitBucket instead of GitHub but the concepts are very similar and we'll cover the other two later.)
So we'll start with that.

<ol>
   <li>Before you can contribute to other projects, you'll have to learn <a href="/git">Git</a>. That page has plenty of links to follow. The slides have exercises as well.</li>
   <li>Read <a href="/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project">How to contribute to an Open Source project?</a></li>
   <li>Go over the slides of: <a href="https://code-maven.com/slides/collab-dev/">Collaborative Development and Open Source Projects</a> and do the exercies.</li>
   <li>Better yet, read the book I wrote specifically for this: <a href="https://leanpub.com/collab-dev-git/">Collaborative Development using Git and GitHub</a></li>

</ol>

As Python programmer you will have to know Python quite well.
As DevOps engineer or as a Test Automation engineer you will need to know one of the programming languages. Python is one of the common choices.
