I strongly believe that one of the best ways to gain experience in hi-tech - even without already working in the field -
is to particpate in Open Source projects. There are project in almost every field and you can practice almost every
type of job in these projects. Not only programmer, but QA, tester, documentation writer, designer, project manager,
support person etc.

I have already created a list of <a href="/open-source-desktop-applications">Open Source Desktop applications</a>,
and there is also the beginning of the <a href="/open-source-web-applications">Open Source Web application frameworks</a>
and the <b>Ready-made downloadable and deployable Open Source web applications</b>
so this time let's see the projects where you can have a direct impact on a live web site.

<h2>Live web sites and web applications with editable source code</h2>

What I mean here is that the source of the web site is available on some public version control system so anyone can contribute to it.
It does not necessarily need to be reusable. In many cases the web sites are very specific and thus their source code is really only
relevant for them, but if it is accessible to anyone then we can learn from it and we might even contribute back to it.

In general I think for every Open Source project, if they have a web site, it is usually like this. They are however usually not that
interesting as those sites are static.

Many projects have their site hosted on GitHub pages. The source code of GitHub pages itself is not available, but the way the content
is generated might be.

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://pyvideo.org/">PyVideo</a> is a static web site hosted on GitHub pages with a small portion, the search engine, hosted elsewhere. It is written in Python using the <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican static site generator</a> The source of both code and data are available on <a href="https://github.com/pyvideo/">GitHub</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://mattermost.com/">Mattermost</a> a chat system like Slack.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> <a href="https://github.com/reddit">source</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> - PHP - Runs on <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://libre.fm/">Libre.fm</a> for <a href="https://gnu.io/fm/">developers</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://readthedocs.org/"></a> has a page for <a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contribute.html">contributors</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> - Perl, ElasticSearch - <a href="https://github.com/metacpan">source on GitHub</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/">GitHub</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://exercism.io/">Exercism</a> <a href="https://github.com/exercism">GitHub</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://sqitch.org/">Sqitch</a> has a static site hosted on GitHub pages and genrated using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. <a href="https://sqitch.org/site/">source</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/">Perl Weekly Challenge</a> source on <a href="https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge">GitHub</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.rexify.org/">Rexify</a> the web site is powered by <a href="http://preaction.me/statocles/">Statocles</a>, and continuously integrated and deployed to GitHub Pages thanks using TravisCI. Source is publicly
available at <a href="https://github.com/RexOps/rexify-website">rexify-website</a> including both code and content.</li>
</ul>


<h3>My web sites</h3>

I know they are not as important for the world as they are to mee, but then again, I can provide more help in case you decide you'd
like to contribute.

<ul>
    <li>The <a href="/">Code Maven</a> site itself is open source <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/Perl-Maven">Perl-Maven</a>. It is written in Perl.</li>
    <li>The free content of the web site is also available so you can help fixing typos and other errors: <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.com/">content of code-maven.org</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://pydigger.com/">PyDigger</a> with <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/pydigger.com/">source</a></li>
</ul>
