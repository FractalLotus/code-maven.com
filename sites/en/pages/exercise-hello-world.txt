Try your environment:

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have access to the right version of your language.
     <ul>
       <li>Perl 5: As of this writing version 5.22 is already out, but most of the material will work on 5.10 and even 5.8, if you cannot upgrade.</li>
       <li>Perl 6: Rakudo 2015.09 or newer</li>
       <li>Ruby: 2.0.x will be fine, thought 2.2.x would be better.</li>
       <li>Python: 2.7.x is a good series. 2.6.x will work with most of the examples. In the Python 3 series any of 3.4.x will work fine.</li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Check you can read the documentation.
<!--
    <ul>
