Learn Crystal with me!

In this series of meetings we are going to learn the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal programming language</a> together.

=abstract end

I have a lot of background programming and teaching other programming languages and I have been learning Crystal myself since
May 15, 2021. As I learn the language I prepare small examples that eventually become a series of
<a href="/slides/crystal/">slides for the Crystal programming language</a>.
During this course and workshop I'll go over the slides I already have and will create more examples and
more slides as we make progress.

During each session I'll give a presentation and then you'll have time to practice. I'll be around helping you and learning from you!
