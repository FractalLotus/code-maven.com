For a Continuous Integration system ideally the Version Control system should trigger the Jenkins jobs when new code was piushed out, but sometimes this is not possible.
The next best thing is to let Jenkins periodically check for anything new.

<h2>Jenkins periodic polling</h2>

Check the Version Control System every minute if there were changes since the last time.

<code>
triggers {
    pollSCM '* * * * *'
}
</code>
