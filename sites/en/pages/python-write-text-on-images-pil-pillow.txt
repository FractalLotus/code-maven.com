This could be used for any image, but for the example we use this <a href="/create-images-with-python-pil-pillow">image
that was created using Python</a>:

<img src="/img/pil_color.png">

A slightly generic script to write text in the top left corner: (Coordintates (0, 0))

<include file="examples/python/pil_write_on_image.py">

The result looks like this:

<img src="/img/pil_text_hello.png">
