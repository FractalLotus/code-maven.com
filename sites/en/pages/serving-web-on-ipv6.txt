Much slower than expected but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a> seems to be gaining ground. I don't
have any general statistics, but all of the VPS hosting companies I work with support IPv6 and even at homes networks I
have encountered IPv6.

So on the network layer many of my users have IPv6 enabled, and my servers also have it, but how can I make sure the web
server also serves both IPv4 and IPv6?

=abstract end

I'll start with the verification as you will also need to do that both before you make changes - to see what are the
problems - and after you make changes - to see if you have managed to fix them.

<h2>IPv6 on the network</h2>

<h2>Verify HTTP and HTTPs over IPv4 and IPv6</h2>

<a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> allows us to send http request. It has a <hl>-I</hl> flag that tells it to only
display the header we get. There is also a <hl>-4</hl> flag that tells it to use IPv4 and a <hl>-6</hl> flag that makes
it use IPv6.

So here is how I can check the site:

First I make sure that the request to http will redirect to the corresponding https page when using IPv4:

<code>
$ curl -I -4 http://code-maven.com/

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sun, 05 May 2019 15:44:47 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 193
Connection: keep-alive
Location: https://code-maven.com/
</code>

Then verify the same over Ipv6:

<code>
$ curl -I -6 http://code-maven.com/

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sun, 05 May 2019 15:48:09 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 193
Connection: keep-alive
Location: https://code-maven.com/
</code>

I can check the redirection for the www.code-maven.com hostname as well.

Then I can verify if the https version serves the page. First over IPv4 and then over IPv6.
In each case I can use <hl>-I</hl> to see the header or leave out the <hl>-I</hl> and see the actual html
content returned.

<code>
$ curl -I -4 https://code-maven.com/

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sun, 05 May 2019 15:49:24 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 11559
Connection: keep-alive
</code>

<code>
$ curl -I -6 https://code-maven.com/

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sun, 05 May 2019 15:51:39 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 11510
Connection: keep-alive
</code>

<h2>Wrong configuration</h2>

Before I fixed this domain I had results like this:

<code>
$ curl -I -4 http://code-maven.com/

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sun, 05 May 2019 15:44:47 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 193
Connection: keep-alive
Location: https://code-maven.com/
</code>

<code>
$ curl -I -6 http://code-maven.com/

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sun, 05 May 2019 15:48:09 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 193
Connection: keep-alive
Location: http://hostlocal.com/
</code>

That is, the http version over IPv4 redirected to the right place
while http over IPv6 redirected to a different site. (That was the default site on the specific server.)


<h2>How to configure Nginx to serve over both Ipv4 and IPv6</h2>

I am using an old version of Ubuntu and thus an old version of Nginx. I think the defaults have changed since then and
you might not need all this configuration, but as far as I understand explicitly configuring this won't cause
problems even in newer versions of nginx.


Tell each <b>https</b> <hl>server</hl> section in your Nginx configuration to work on both IPv6 (the first row) and on IPv4 (second row):

<code>
  listen    [::]:443 ssl;
  listen    443 ssl;
</code>

Tell each <b>http</b> <hl>server</hl> section in your Nginx configuration to work on both IPv6 (the first row) and on IPv4 (second row):

<code>
  listen     [::]:80;
  listen     80;
</code>


Once you made the changes, reload nginx, and verify with <hl>curl</hl>.
