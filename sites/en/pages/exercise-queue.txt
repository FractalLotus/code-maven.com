=abstract start

The application should manage a queue of people.

=abstract end

<ul>
  <li>It will prompt the user for a new name by printing <hl>:</hl>.</li>
  <li>The user can type in a name and press ENTER.</li>
  <li>The app will add the name to the queue.</li>
  <li>If the user types in "n" then the application will print the first name in the queue.</li>
</ul>

A sample interaction will look like this:

<code>
: Foo
: Bar
: Moo
: n
  next is Foo
: n
  next is Bar
: Peter
: n
  next is Moo
: n
  next is Peter
: n
  the queue is empty
</code>
