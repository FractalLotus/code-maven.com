I have heard about this language called <a href="https://www.raku.org/">Raku</a> and thought of giving it a try.
Searching for "raku programming language" brought me a Wikipedia page and then the above link. Then something about
Perl 6.

<h2>Install from source</h2>

Clicking the big <b>Download Rakudo</b> button there are instructions on how to install <b>Rakudo Star</b> from source on Linux.
So I did that using version 2019.03. Or at least I started but got this error on my Ubuntu:

<code>
/usr/bin/perl tools/build/gen-cat.pl moar src/QRegex/P5Regex/Grammar.nqp src/QRegex/P5Regex/Actions.nqp src/QRegex/P5Regex/Compiler.nqp  > gen/moar/stage2/NQPP5QRegex.nqp
./nqp-m --target=mbc --output=NQPP5QRegex.moarvm \
    gen/moar/stage2/NQPP5QRegex.nqp
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
make: *** [Makefile:420: NQPP5QRegex.moarvm] Error 139
Command failed (status 512): make
Command failed (status 512): /usr/bin/perl Configure.pl --prefix=/home/gabor/rakudo --backends=moar --make-install
</code>

There is also a link to "Installing from binaries" on various operating systems.

<code>
sudo apt-get install rakudo
</code>

Installs the <b>perl6</b> command. I would have not been able to guess this if I did not have some background in the subject.

What version is that?

<code>
perl6 -v
This is Rakudo version 2018.12 built on MoarVM version 2018.12
implementing Perl 6.d.
</code>

Sounds pretty old.

<h2>Tutorial</h2>

Then I went back to the main page of <a href="https://www.raku.org/">Raku</a> to look for some tutorial that would tell me how to write a
"Hello World" script. There was no link to a "Tutorial". There was a link to "Documentation", but that looks too complex to me.
There is also a "Getting started" hidden at the bottom of the page. It has some promision links, for example to the <a href="https://raku.guide/">Raku guide</a>.

For example I'd like to know what is the expected extension for a Raku program.

So here is my Hello World:

<h2>Hello World</h2>

I've created a file called <b>hello_world.raku</b>:

<include file="examples/raku/hello_world.raku">

Then ran it as:

<code>
perl6 hello_world.raku
</code>

<h2>Plans</h2>

I plan to re-visit Raku once in a while, also updating this page.


<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

Yes, I know that Raku is the new name of Perl 6, I have been in the neighbourhood for a long time.
Now I try to look at it with fresh eyes. As much as I can.
Hoping that it helps both the developers of Raku and the potential users.
