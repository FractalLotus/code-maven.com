During this meeting <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferki/">Ferenc Erki</a>, the lead developer of <a href="https://www.rexify.org/">Rex</a>
is going to lead us setting up a system using several different Linux distributions and handling the differences.

We will also attempt to set up a full <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">ELK stack</a>.

We will start where we left of las time when FErki gave us an <a href="/automation-with-rex">introduction to Rex</a>

<h2>Plan</h2>

<h2>ELK</h2>

Most of this will be probably delayed to a future meeting:

<ul>
   <li>Download the rpm file of ElasticSearch and install on a CentOS based box.</li>
   <li>Configure the /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml file</li>
   <li>Make sure we can access it locally with curl</li>
   <li>Install Kibana on another machine</li>
   <li>Configure ElastiSearch and Kibana so Kibana can access ElasticSearch</li>
   <li>Configure Nginx on the Kibana machine as a reverse proxy and add Basic Authentication.</li>
   <li>Install Metricbeat on all the machines and make them send the data to the ElasticSearch</li>
   <li>Add different tags to the instances.</li>
   <li>Install our log generator application on one of the boxes.</li>
   <li>Install Logstash on one of the boxes</li>
   <li>Install Filebeat on the box with the log generator application</li>
   <li>Configure filebeat to process the logfile and send it to the Logstash</li>
   <li>Configure Logstash to accept the data from filebeat and send it to ElasTicsearch</li>
</ul>
