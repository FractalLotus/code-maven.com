=abstract start

In order to generate pseudo-random numbers in Groovy, we can use the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#random--">Math.random()</a>
method or the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html">Random</a>
class provided by Java.

<h2>Random float</h2>

The <hl>random</hl> method will generate a floating point number between 0 and 1.
(0 included 1 excluded).

<h2>Random integers</h2>

<include file="examples/groovy/random_integers.gvy">

In the next example we have a list of one-letter strings and we would like to
pick one of the elements randomly. So we need an integer between 0 and the size of the
array.

We run it in a loop so we can see more values picked.
