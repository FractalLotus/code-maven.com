Exercise: add more statistics

See other <a href="/exercises">exercises</a>.

=abstract end

Take the solution from the <a href="/exercise-sum-of-numbers-in-file">count sum exercise</a> where we added up the numbers in each row of a file,
and add additional statistical values:

<ul>
  <li>minumum</li>
  <li>maximum</li>
  <li>average</li>
</ul>

If you are following the <a href="/exercises">exercises</a> then caluclating median and standard deviation might too difficult at this point, but you can give them a try.
