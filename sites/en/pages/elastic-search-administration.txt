Just some random <hl>curl</hl> command that help me with the administration and the configuration of an Elasticsearch
cluster.


=abstract end


List of cats:

<code>
http://localhost:9200/_cat/
</code>

List indices:

<code>
http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v
</code>


Health of the system (should contain the word green)
<code>
http://localhost:9200/_cat/health
</code>

<code>
http://localhost:9200/_all/_settings
</code>


The health of the cluster:

<code>
http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health
</code>

Cluster settings

<code>
curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings
</code>

Delete index:

<code>
curl  -X DELETE http://localhost:9200/index-name
</code>

Set temporary (transient) the low disk watermark

<code>
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings  -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{ "transient": {"cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low": "5%" } }'
</code>


Set the number of replicas to 1

<code>
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/experimental/_settings  -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{ "index": {"number_of_replicas" : 1} }'
</code>

Tell the index to have no replicas. That is to have exactly one copy of each piece of data. No redundancy.
Useful if you only have a single node in your "cluster".

<code>
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/experimental/_settings  -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{ "index": {"number_of_replicas" : 0} }'
</code>
