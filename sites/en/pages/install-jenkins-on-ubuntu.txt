In order to experiment with Jenkins, I am going to use <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtialBox</a> to set up a box running <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 17.10</a>.

=abstract end

<h2>Install Vagrant and VirtualBox</h2>

Nothing special, you just need to install the two applications with using the standard
installation process of your operating system. Download <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtialBox</a> and intsall them both.


<h2>Set up the Ubuntu 17.10 box using Vagrant</h2>

Create an empty directory and in that directory create a file called <hl>Vagrantfile</hl> (no extension) with the following content:

<code>
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  config.vm.box = "generic/ubuntu1710"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host:8080
  #config.vm.synced_folder "/Users/gabor/work", "/vagrant"
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.memory = "512"
  end
end
</code>

Open a terminal window or in MS Windows a Command window. Change to the directory you created for our work. Then type in

<code>
vagrant up
</code>

This will take some time as it first downloads an Ubuntu image and then it will create a VirtualBox and set up the Ubuntu image as a new Virtual Box.  (It took me about 5-10 minutes.)

Once it completed the createtion successfully you can log in to the machine by typing:

<code>
vagrant ssh
</code>

<h2>Install Jenkins</h2>

Execute the following commands inside the VirtualBox image (after you ran <hl>vagrant ssh</hl> and were logged in to the Virtual Box).

<include file="examples/jenkins/sudo.txt">

<h2>Check if Vagrant is running</h2>

From inside the Virtual Box images you can run the following command:

<code>
curl http://localhost:8080/
</code>

You will most likely get some message about being forbidden. That's actually a good sign.


<h2>Set up Vagrant</h2>

Visit the newly installed Jenkins using your regular browser on your computer by following this URL:

http://localhost:8080/login?from=%2F

You should see something like this:

<img src="/img/unlock-jenkins.png">

Basically the following text:

<code>
Unlock Jenkins

To ensure Jenkins is securely set up by the administrator, a password has been written to the log (not sure where to find it?) and this file on the server:

/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Please copy the password from either location and paste it below.
Administrator password
</code>

On the command line type in the following:

<code>
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
</code>

This will print the password. Something like this:

<code>
da3160af7d0f4c8db649d4b8000380a6
</code>

Copy that string and paste in the above window.

The next page will offer you to Customize Jenkins:

<img src="/img/customize-jenkins.png">

Select <hl>Install suggested plugins</hl>

You will see a progress window saying <hl>Getting Started</hl>:

<img src="/img/getting-started-jenkins.png">

After a while it finished and shows a new page asking you to
<hl>Create Firs Admin User</hl>:

<img src="/img/create-first-admin-user-jenkins.png">

I typed in "foobar" as the username, "Foo Bar" as the Full name
and my real e-mail address.

Then that's done you will see a page confirming our success:
