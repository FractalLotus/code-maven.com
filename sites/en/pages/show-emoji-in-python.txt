=abstract start

Tons of web site and applications allow the use of Emoji.
There is even an <a href="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/">Emoji cheat sheet</a> to show the available Emojis.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji">Wikipedia explains</a> that some of the Emoji were standardized as
Unicode characters.

=abstract end

There is a Python module, surprisingly called <a href="https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji">emoji</a> that allows
us to include Emoji in Python based applications.  A simple example would look like this:

<include file="examples/python/show_emoji.py">

And the output looks like this:

<code>
Python is üëç
Python is üç™
</code>
