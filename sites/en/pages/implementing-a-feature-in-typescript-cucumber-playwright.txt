=abstract start

In this live session <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tallybarak/">Tally Barak</a> and myself worked on her <a href="https://github.com/Tallyb/cucumber-playwright">cucumber-playwright</a> project
implementing a <a href="https://github.com/Tallyb/cucumber-playwright/issues/60">feature request</a>.

=abstract end

At the begining Tally introduced the tools in the project starting with <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> from where many of the enegineers
working on <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a> came from.

We talked about <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a> and <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/">Gherkin</a> and in general about BDD.

See also the <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber">repository of cucumber</a> and a  <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/">reference of Gherkin</a>.

Tally has a number of <a href="https://tally-b.medium.com/">blog posts on Medium</a> about the subject. e.g
<a href="https://tally-b.medium.com/5-ways-playwright-is-awesome-b94eff4da0ea">5 Ways Playwright is Awesome</a> and
<a href="https://tally-b.medium.com/e2e-testing-with-cucumber-and-playwright-9584d3ef3360">E2E Testing with Cucumber and Playwright</a>.

We used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and learned that you can set environment varibles on the command line of MS Windows using

<code>
set NAME=value
</code>
