=abstract start

On a computer, every image is made out of pixels in various colors.
If the image is very smooth then we have a lot of pixels. Still just pixels.

If we want to save a picture to a file basically we can have two options.
Either we save the pixels which is called <b>raster image</b>, or we store instructions
how to draw lines in order to generate the pixels. This is called <b>vector image</b>.

The advantage of vector graphics is that we can enlarge the image without loss of quality.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</a> is
an XML file containing instructions to draw an image.  <a href="http://svgjs.com/">SVG.JS</a> is 
a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create such XML file and even without saving them
to disk, to use them to draw images on a web site.

Just as we saw a <a href="https://perlmaven.com/scalable-vector-graphics-with-perl">examples for SVG images drawn with Perl</a>,
let's see a few simple examples with the JavaScript library.

<script src="/try/examples/js/svg.min.js"></script>

Download the implementation of <a href="http://svgjs.com/">SVG.JS</a> using
<hl>wget https://raw.github.com/wout/svg.js/master/dist/svg.min.js</hl>
or some other way and let's start drawing.

<h2>Square</h2>

Create the following two files:

An HTML file that loads the <hl>svg.min.js</hl> we have just downloaded. This can go anywhere in the HTML file.

Then we add an HTML  element with an id. (<hl>square_1</hl> in our case). This is where the drawing will be placed.

Finally we load a JavaScript file where we put the instructions. Unless we employ some kind of delayed execution,
this JavaScript file has to come after the other two.

<try file="examples/js/svg_square.html">

The other file is the JavaScript file with the instruction.
The <hl>SVG()</hl> function gets the <hl>id</hl> of the HTML element where we want to put our drawing.
This returns an object. On this object we can call various methods that will impact the drawing.

<include file="examples/js/svg_square.js">

The result will look like this:

<div id="square_1"></div>
<script src="/try/examples/js/svg_square.js"></script>

<h2>Circle</h2>

In order to draw a circle it is enough to provide its diameter:

<include file="examples/js/svg_circle.js">

And have the appropriate HTML file to load the JavaScript:

<try file="examples/js/svg_circle.html">


<div id="circle_1"></div>

<script src="/try/examples/js/svg_circle.js"></script>

<h2>Polygon</h2>

<include file="examples/js/svg_polygon.js">

And have the appropriate HTML file to load the JavaScript:

<try file="examples/js/svg_polygon.html">

<div id="polygon_1"></div>

<script src="/try/examples/js/svg_polygon.js"></script>
