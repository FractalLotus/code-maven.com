I am running <a href="/live">live</a> online events that people can join from anywhere in the world if they know when the events start. Computing and showing the
date and time in every possible timezone is exhausting and would be probably confusing to the reader. The best is to show the scheduled date and time
in their local time-zone.

Encouraged by the <a href="https://dev.to/mjgardner/localizing-dates-in-a-perl-web-application-with-javascript-1n24">posts of Mark Gardner</a> I wanted to implement
it using JavaScript only. This is what I got:

=abstract end
