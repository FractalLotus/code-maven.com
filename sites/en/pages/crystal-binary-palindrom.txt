=abstract start

A Binary Palindrom is a positive integer for which the binary representation is a palindrom.
See the <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-118/">Weekly challange</a>.

This is a solution in the <a href="/crystal">Crystal programming language</a>.

<h2>Directory layout</h2>

</code>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<include file="examples/crystal/binary_palindrome/src/palindrome.cr">

In Crystal you can have <b>?</b> as the last character of a function name.
It is often used for functions that return a boolean value.

The original requets was for returning 1 and 0, but most likely it was defined that way
because Perl does not have a special boolean type. In the Crystal solution I opted to return <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>
respectively as that's the right way to do it in Crystal.

Functions in Crystal return the value of the last statement so the <b>return</b> keyword is optional, but I prefer to have it explicitely.

Extra: If the function is called with a negative value an ArgumentError exception is raised.

<h2>Usage</h2>

A simple Crystal program that will accept one or more numbers on the command line and will print Yes or No for
each number:

<code>
$ crystal src/use_palindrome.cr 3 4 5
3 Yes
4 No
5 Yes
</code>

<include file="examples/crystal/binary_palindrome/src/use_palindrome.cr">

<ul>
   <li><b>ARGV</b> is an array of string containing the values from the command line</li>
   <li><b>#{}</b> is interpolation of variables and expressions inside a string</li>
   <li>A string can be delimitered using double-quotes <b>"</b> or this construct: <b>%[]</b> where you can use any type of brackets.</li>
   <li><b>ARGV.each</b> iterates over the elements of <b>ARGV</b> and on each iteration the current value is assigned to the "number" variable.</li>
   <li><b>to_i</b> converts a string to an integer.</li>
   <li><b>?:</b> is just the conditional operator (aka. the ternary operator)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Spec tests</h2>

I also included a test script.

<include file="examples/crystal/binary_palindrome/spec/palindrome_spec.cr">

In order to run the tests <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">install Crystal</a>,
re-created the directory layout with the two files.
(You can clone <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.com/">the repository</a> and cd to <b>examples/crystal/binary_palindrome/</b>)
Then  run

<code>
crystal spec
