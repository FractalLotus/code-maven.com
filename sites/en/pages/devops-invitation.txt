=abstract start

On this site we cover a number of DevOps-related topics.
For example <a href="/docker">Docker</a>, <a href="/jenkins">Jenkins</a>
<a href="/ansible">Ansible</a>, and <a href="/git">Git</a>. Just to name a few.

=abstract end

There are also pages about <a href="/groovy">Groovy</a>, the language used in Jenkins.


You can find other, more generic topics such as <a href="/linux">Linux</a>, <a href="/shell">Bash</a>, and <a href="/python">Python</a>.

We also have video recordings, for example the one with <a href="/site-reliability-engineer-at-adobe-rachael-bates">Rachael Bates, SRE at Adobe</a>.

Some of our content is only <a href="https://code-maven.com/archive?tag=pro">available to paying subscribers</a>, but some of those
are always available to <a href="https://code-maven.com/archive?tag=preview">preview</a>.
You only need to <a href="/pm/register">register</a> on the site to get access to the videos in preview mode.

If you are not interested registering here you can get DevOps-related tips 3-5 times a week by following our
<a href="https://linkedin.com/showcase/code-maven-devops/">DevOps specific LinkedIn page</a>
