    <li>What are your responsibilities?</li>
    <li>What is your daily job?</li>
    <li>What tools do you use?</li>
    <li>Do you work remotely? How do you handle it? What are the new challenges? How do you deal with them?</li>
    <li>Can you tell me about a serious issue you encountered? How did you handle it?</li>
</ul>

and also

<ul>
    <li>How can one become an SRE?</li>
