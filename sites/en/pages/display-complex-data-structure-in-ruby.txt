Creating complex data structures (hashes of hashes of arrays of hashes of arrays....) is easy in Ruby.

Unedrstanding what we have on our hand can be a bit more difficult.

Perl has a build in modules called <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Dumper">Data::Dumper</a>
that can be used to pirnt complex data structures, for example when
<a href="https://perlmaven.com/debugging-perl-scripts">debugging Perl programs</a>.

Ruby has <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/pp/rdoc/PP.html">pp, the Pretty Printer</a> for the same purpose.
