=abstract start

In the <a href="/counter">big counter example</a> we see a number of implementations of counters.
Here is one using <a href="/angularjs">AngularJS</a>.

=abstract end

<h2>Simple button to increment counter</h2>

<try file="examples/angular/in_memory_counter.html">

In this example we have an HTML button that has two Angular attributes.
<hl>ng-init</hl> will be executed once when the page loads. It gives the initial value to the
attribute <hl>counter</hl>.

The content of <hl>ng-click</hl> will be executed every time we click on the button. That will increment the counter by 1.
(<hl>counter++</hl> does not work here)

When we load the page we can see the button "Increment" and the number 0. Then as we click on the button the number
gets incremented.

<h2>Increment and decrement buttons</h2>

In the next example we have added another button to decrement the counter by 1.
In addition, in order to make the step clearly separated, we have moved the <hl>ng-init</hl> attribute to
a separate <hl>div</hl> element which is not going to be displayed at all.

<h2>In-memory counter with controller</h2>

In preparation from some more substantial actions behind the counter,
in the third example we have move the code decrementing the counter to a controller.
(The button incrementing the counter was left as it was before.)

This time we've created an <a href="/hello-world-with-angular-controller">Angular module and controller</a>,
in which we set the default value of <hl>$scope.counter</hl> to 0 and we have also defined a method called
<hl>decrement</hl>. As this is already plain JavaScript, here we can already use the autoincrement and autodecrement
expression like this one: <hl>counter--</hl>.

In the HTML we set <hl>ng-click="decrement()"</hl> which means the <hl>decrement</hl>
method will be called every time a button is pressed.
