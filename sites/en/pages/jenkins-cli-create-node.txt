In some situation you might need to add nodes (aka. agents) programmatically to a Jenkins setup.
This is a shell script to register the new node based on the <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChristopherDavenport/bc5ba7a33d5dd5fc975da81c4a270a90">gist of Christopher Davenport</a>.

Notes:

<ul>
   <li>"Agent" and "node" is often used interchangably and in the old days they were called "slaves" so you will still see that word used in some documentation and in the code.</li>
   <li>The origrinal name of the Jenkins project was Hudson and that too still appears in a lot of the code.</li>
   <li>remove the -remoting flag</li>
</ul>
