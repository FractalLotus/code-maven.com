Project idea

As a developer (and GitHub user) I would like to be able to easily see all the <a href="/github-pull-requests-waiting-for-me">pull-requests waiting for me</a>.
Both in my own projects (my username) and my organizations. I might want to easily filter organizations.

I would like to be able to see which one of the PRs are really waiting for me (e.g. exclude the onese where I added the most recent comment and there were no updates since then.)

As a developer I'd like to be able to see the stale PRs (PR sent to my projects, where I asked for update - that is the last comment is from me) and that is more than N days old.

As a developer I would like to see all the issues open in my projects (under my username and under my organizations). Here too I'd like to be able to filter those where the last comment is not from me.
I can do this partially using this <a href="https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Aszabgab+archived%3Afalse+">search</a>.

As a newbie I'd like to be able to locate projects in GitHub that are relatively new, have been recently updated (maybe even updated multiple times, that I know are actively developed.)
I'd like to be able to filter based on programming languge. Do they have tests? Probably I'd like to filter them based on the star-count (E.g. between 2-8 stars - projects that have been noticed but not yet popular)

As a developer I'd like to have an easy overview of all of my projects answering questions like:
Do they have GitHub Actions configured? Travis-CI?

As a developer I might want to have a dashboard, similar to the <a href="https://cpandashboard.com/">CPAN Dashboard</a>, but for all of my GitHub projects. (And all of my GitLab and BitBucket projects as well.)

As a developer I'd like to mark projects as "old" and make sure they are either not show up in the searches for issues and pull-requests or they are always a the bottom of the list.
