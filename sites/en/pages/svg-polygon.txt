=abstract start

This is part of the <a href="/svg">SVG Tutorial and exercises</a> drawing a Polygon in SVG.

=abstract end

<script src="/try/examples/js/svg.min.js"></script>

<div id="polygon_1"></div>
<script src="/try/examples/js/svg_polygon_1.js"></script>
<include file="examples/js/svg_polygon_1.js">

A polygon is very similar to a <a href="/svg-polyline">Polyline</a>, but it is a closed
shape. The last point in the list of points is connected back to the first point.

In this example we provided 4 points and got some strange shape.
