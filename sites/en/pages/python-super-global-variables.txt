I just saw a lovely idea in Python to create super-global variables.

That is variable that will be available somehow globally in all the packages.

=abstract end

It was done by creating attributes on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/builtins.html">builtins</a> module Like this:

<include file="examples/python/super_global.py">

Then you can use them like this:

<include file="examples/python/use_super_global.py">

My gut feeling is that this is not such a good idea.
