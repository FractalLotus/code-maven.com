How can we check if a merge is going to create a conflict or not without actually doing the merge.

Apparently there is no single command for this, but it is easy to do:

=abstract end

<code>
git merge --no-commit --no-ff BRANCH-TO-MERGE
echo $?
git merge --abort
</code>

The first command will try to merge, but without committing the change and without fast-forwarding.

This command will succeed if the merge can be executed and it will fail if there is a conflict.
So we can check if the exit code <hl>$?</hl> was 0 (success) of non-zeo (failure).
Then we have to clean up the partial merge.
